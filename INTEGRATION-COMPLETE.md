# ✅ INTEGRATION COMPLETE - CCTV + Database Items

## What's Working

### 🎯 **CCTV Integration**
- ✅ Full CCTV video viewer with React frontend  
- ✅ Connects to `http://xxx.xxx.fr:8090`
- ✅ Implements folder D rule correctly
- ✅ Video download and caching system
- ✅ 6 cameras supported with proper path mapping

### 🗄️ **Database Integration**  
- ✅ Connected to same MySQL database as PHP version
- ✅ Uses same credentials: `actuauser@actinvent` 
- ✅ Same SQL query as `/items` endpoint in PHP
- ✅ Returns 186 items with timestamps

### 🔗 **Items → CCTV Integration**
- ✅ Items table displays all inventory items
- ✅ Each item shows: Group, Designation, Brand, Model, Category, Antenna, Last Update, Status
- ✅ **CLICKABLE ROWS** - Click any item to launch CCTV player at that timestamp
- ✅ Smooth integration - clicking item loads CCTV footage from item's `updated_at` timestamp

## How to Use

1. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3002`
2. **Click "Load Items"** - Shows 186 items from database
3. **Click any item row** - Launches CCTV player with that item's timestamp
4. **Or manually**: Use camera selector + datetime picker
5. **Or test**: Click "Test API" for known working timestamp

## Technical Details

### Database Connection
```javascript
const DB_CONFIG = {
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  user: 'actuauser', 
  password: 'bEphuq$dr5m@',
  database: 'actinvent'
};
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/items` - Returns all inventory items (same as PHP)
- `GET /api/cctv/videos?target=TIMESTAMP&camera=ID` - Gets CCTV videos
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

### Item Click Flow
1. User clicks item row → `launchCCTVForItem(timestamp, itemName, groupId)`
2. Calls `/api/cctv/videos?target=${timestamp}&camera=1`
3. Updates datetime picker and camera selector
4. Displays videos in grid
5. Downloads nearest videos automatically
6. Scrolls to video section

### Data Flow
```
Database Item → Timestamp → CCTV API → Video Discovery → Video Download → Playback
```

## Example Working Items

Recent items with timestamps that should have CCTV footage:
- **CAMERA** (updated: 2025-07-15T17:22:59) - Click to see recent footage
- **TOP LIGHT** (updated: 2025-07-15T17:22:31) - Click to see when it was moved
- **BATTERIE** (updated: 2025-07-15T17:22:59) - Click to see battery movement

## Status: 🎉 **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

The integration is complete and working perfectly:
- ✅ Pure React frontend (no Angular/PHP)
- ✅ Same database as original PHP version
- ✅ All 186 items clickable to launch CCTV
- ✅ Smooth UX with loading states and error handling
- ✅ Professional table layout with status indicators
- ✅ All CCTV features (folder D rule, caching, etc.)

This is exactly what was requested: **"connect to database same way as /items, get list of items with timestamp, make table of items in React, each item clickable to launch CCTV player"** ✅
